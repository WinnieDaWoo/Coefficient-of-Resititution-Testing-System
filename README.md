# A Coefficient of Restitution Testing System for Baseballs

The central task of this project was to design and construct a system to reliably and accurately determine the COR of a baseball with a piece of wood as a function of the relative velocity between the two bodies. This system was designed as part of a one month project CAPSTONE introduction project.

An air cannon, optical laser gate, collision tube assembly was created to determine the coefficient of restitution (COR) between a baseball and a piece of wood as a function of the relative velocity between the two bodies. A PVC compressed air cannon rated for 120 psi accelerated a baseball to speeds nearing 70 mph, and an optical laser gate captured the speed of the baseball before and after a collision with a piece of wood (ash or pine). The collision was facilitated by a collision tube racked at the end of the cannon barrel. Values for COR from baseball to baseball were consistent to within plus or minus 0.4 at various inbound velocities between 20 and 70 mph. The COR appeared to decrease as the inbound velocity increased. However, not enough data were collected to confidently apply a mathematical model to relate the two quantities. The coefficient of determination for two attempted linear fits were 0.59 and 0.78.
